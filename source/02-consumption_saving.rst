两时期消费-储蓄模型
===================

导论
----

本讲讨论简单的两时期消费-储蓄问题。在该模型中，家庭部门根据外生的收入流进行消费和储蓄决策。This
note works through some simple two-period consumption-saving problems.
In this model households receive an exogenous stream of income and have
to decide how much to consume and save. Two periods is the minimum
number of periods to make problems dynamic; it also turns out that you
can usually split infinite horizon problems into two periods (the
present and a future continuation value), so focusing on two periods
does not cost us much.
